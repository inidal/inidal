## üëã Hi there, I‚Äôm Nidal.

I am a self-taught software developer based in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada üá®üá¶. My primary focus is on JavaScript and Python, but I am currently expanding my knowledge by learning Rust. In addition to my technical skills, I have a background in human resource management. Outside of work, I enjoy writing and mixing music, which I share on platforms such as [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/Edmyria) and [Bandcamp](https://edmyria.bandcamp.com/). If you would like to get in touch with me, please feel free to email me at hello@inidal.dev.

## ü§ù Volunteering
### [Nasqueron](https://devcentral.nasqueron.org/) ([repo](https://github.com/nasqueron))
I joined Nasqueron due to its positive culture and community. The organization fosters a highly collaborative environment where communication flows freely, and members readily provide mentorship. Furthermore, Nasqueron's well-organized projects and focus on simplifying software deployment and management align with my interests and goals as a developer. Overall, I appreciate the supportive and inclusive atmosphere that Nasqueron offers, which enables me to contribute to the development and improvement of open-source software.

## ‚öíÔ∏è Personal Projects
### [corspat](https://corspat.herokuapp.com/) ([repo](https://github.com/inidal/corspat))
For my final project in CS50‚Äôs Introduction to Computer Science, I created Corspat. This platform was born out of my personal need to track the time I spent studying online courses. I had been using spreadsheets to manage my time, but I found that no existing platform offered a comprehensive solution for managing both courses and time spent on each course. As a result, I decided to create Corspat, a single platform that combines all of these features.

### [cyclistic bike data analysis](https://inidal.github.io/ggl-data-capstone/) ([repo](https://github.com/inidal/ggl-data-capstone))
As part of my Capstone Project for the Google Data Analyst Certificate, I analyzed over 3 million rows of data and prepared a comprehensive report. Through this analysis, I was able to gain valuable insights, identify patterns, and interpret consumer behavior.

### [laby](https://discord.gg/7fxhVstURu) ([repo](https://github.com/inidal/laby-bot))
I developed a helper bot that can execute a variety of simple commands upon user request. These commands include weather updates, IMDb queries, translation services, ping tests, and more.
